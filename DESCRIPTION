Title: Mapping out the dependencies between functions
Version: 0.1.7
Author: Chun Fung (Jackson) Kwok
Maintainer: Chun Fung (Jackson) Kwok <kcf.jackson@gmail.com>
Description: A simple tool to map out dependencies between functions
    in a directory / package using `rlang`. This helps analyse packages 
    and refactor code. A distinctive feature of the package is that it 
    supports manual manipulation of the generated map, which then can be
    saved and used as part of package documentation.
